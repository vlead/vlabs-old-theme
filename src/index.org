#+TITLE: Theming of Open edX Platform - Custom HTML pages
#+Author: VLEAD
#+Date: [2017-04-19]

* Introduction
  This document contains the process setting up https://info.vlabs.ac.in


* Problem 
  Since 5959 is not in well-defined port range, most of the
  organizations and institutes block such ports. As a result of this,
  we got an incident reported by an institutes being not able to
  access custom web pages from https://vlabs.ac.in. Example of such a
  page is -
  https://info.vlabs.ac.in/search_feature/disciplines/ElectricalEngineering/index.html

  
* Quick workaround 
  While any change in nginx configuration of Open edX for port 80
  resulted into 500 internal server error, tweaking it any time soon
  is a risk. A quick workaround as discussed in the Meeting on April
  19, 2017 is as given below -

  + Have https://vlabs.ac.in to serve Open edX webpages.
  + Have https://info.vlabs.ac.in to serve our custom pages.
  + Reference to all links with port 5959 can be replaced with corresponding page on https://info.vlabs.ac.in.
  + Have proper links to allow user to navigate on https://vlabs.ac.in and https://info.vlabs.ac.in vice versa.


* Design   
  The concept is as simple as connecting 2 websites using anchor tags. 
  Following will be the flow if a user visits to https://vlabs.ac.in -
  + User visits https://vlabs.ac.in
  + From disciplines section, he say he clicks Electronics and Communication domain.  
  + On click, user must be taken to https://info.vlabs.ac.in to get
    the page for Electronics and Communication page.
  + From there and from every custom page, user can return back to
    https://vlabs.ac.in or continue accessing custom html pages from
    https://info.vlabs.ac.in

* Deployment
  Following are the steps taken to deploy https://info.vlabs.ac.in
  + Launch a VM in AWS (outside cluster). 
  + Take ssh access and install nginx and git-core
    #+BEGIN_SRC command
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get -y install nginx
    sudo apt-get -y install git-core
    #+END_SRC
  + Configure SSL certificates
  + Clone the repository which contains the custom html page source 
    #+BEGIN_SRC command
    git clone https://github.com/openedx-vlead/vlabs-custom-info-pages
    #+END_SRC
  + Copy the contents of =src= folder to /usr/share/nginx/html
  + Restart nginx services 
    #+BEGIN_SRC command
    sudo service nginx restart
    #+END_SRC
 
    
* Testing 
  + Take ssh access to Open edX testing machine - vlabs-test.vlabs.ac.in
  + Clone repository and change the branch to for-info-vlabs -
    #+BEGIN_SRC command
    git clone https://github.com/openedx-vlead/vlabs-edx-bootstrap-theme.git
    git checkout for-info-vlabs
    #+END_SRC
  + Compile theme using standard compilation command as given in [[https://github.com/openedx-vlead/vlabs-edx-bootstrap-theme.git][theme repository]].
  + Check that links having 5959 are now removed and pointing to corresponding link in https://info.vlabs.ac.in

* Post Deployment 
  + Install SSL certificates 
  + Configure nginx to respond back only on https 
  

* Auto deployable version
  The auto deployable version of Open edX is not using nginx. Please
  check the labspec file to check the packages installed in auto
  deployable version of https://info.vlabs.ac.in
