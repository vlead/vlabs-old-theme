              <h3>Project Title: Heap Sort: Algorithm and Complexity</h3>
              <p>    As a part of the VLEAD summer internship, i built a virtual lab for heap sort experiment. I applied pedagogy principles along with literate style programming to render a working app in two months.Building the experiment involved writing a story board as an org file which is exported to html by a parser.This intermediate html grammar was transformed to an abstract syntax tree or the catalogs which mapped to the artifacts i built. Artifacts were API's using javascript libraries like D3 and SVG's. A linker goes through the catalog service and renders the experiment in a shell with all images and interactive JS artifacts.

Looking forward for my experiment to be hosted and put into use.

                Experiment is divided into three main modules:singly,doubly and circular linked list.
                        Each module will have image artefacts introducing inked list,then a demo video of
                interactive artefact and then interactive practice artefact,after that interactive
                exercise artefact and then theoretical quiz.All modules follow same structure.

                We implemented them in our story-board.I wrote questions for pre-quiz and post-quiz part of the story-board.

                   <p>  Worked to define the AST for different types of contents to be rendered in the experiment. Built parser, linker
                     and renderer to render the document written by Instructional Designer with the defined grammar. Built
                     scalable APIs using Node.js for the documents and realizations to be stored in the database(MongoDB).
                     Built the UI for the experiments.

                   <h3>Project Title: UI Design for Data Structure Experiments</h3>
                   <p>  UI and User centric Design for all the experiments such as Image artifacts, Shell designs, and web page. To understand the user it is the big challenge.
                     So I followed the User Experience design process:
                     1.Empathy (User survey,Desk Research,Exploratory Research,Shadowing )
                     2.Define (Affinty Diagram, Conceptual map, Persona, Customer journey map )
                     3.Ideate ( Brainstorming, paper prototype,Wireframes, Idea menu )
                     4.Prototype (Low fidelity, High fidelity prototype )
                     5.Iteration :According to situation need we have to modify the Design
                     By this process I understand the real need of user and according to that I made All the experiments Artifacts Exercise, demo, which was given by mentors.

I worked with SMEs so, for designing the artifacts for exercise or demo, I had to know the theory first So I discussed with them and understood the matter. According to user I Incorporate to design.
                       I learnt new design software tool (sketch), open source tool (Git)

                   <p>   As a UI/UX designer my role was to create a better user friendly virtual labs WEBSITE for IIIT Hyderabad. So i started my work with UX first. First i read the user, then i create some mental model and use case diagram to get the clear idea about what should i put on a website and what should not. Then comes the UI part where i design the website with the help of Elements and Principle of design. How user will perceive, how psychology works, how interaction work with usability all of these things had been a part of my UI design.

I love solving problems i sent them regularly my design ideas they regularly gave me feedbacks for improving my design. All of the working staffs are very generous.
